</p>
<p>
Tickets will appear in the tickets section of the Agent Panel

  - Depending on company protocol or SLA, tickets may be assigned automatically

  - If the ticket remains unassigned an Admin or Agent may go in and assign the ticket to themselves

</p>
<br />

<h3> Assignment & Communication </h3>

</p>
<p>
Depending on the way a ticketing system is set up, factors such as priority or SLA plan may be assigned on their own

  - If none of this is the case, an Admin or Agent may go into the ticket and assign those variables to the ticket

  - They may also transfer the ticket to another department if it is beyond the scope of their knowledge

  - They can also choose to work alongside another department to adress the issue
</p>
<br />

<h3> Working The Issue </h3>

</p>
<p>
The Agent or Admin assigned to the ticket will begin working on a solution for the issue

  - This often begins with them identifying the root of the issue

  - They may consult other departments for their expertise in solving the issue

  - The Agent should remember to stay in frequent communication with the ticket's creator, ensuring that they are not left in the dark on the issue

<h3> Resolution </h3>

</p>
<p>
Once a solution to the issue is found, the Agent or Admin can impliment it

  - The ticket creator should always be made aware that a solution has been found and will be deployed

  - the better the line of communication is between all parties involved, the better the system can run

  - Once the solution has been implimented and the ticket creator informed, the Agent can close the ticket, marking it as 'Resolved'
